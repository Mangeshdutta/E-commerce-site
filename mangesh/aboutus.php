        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h2>Ecommerce Shopping Site</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3><hr/>
        <p>Ecommerce Shopping Site is an Online Website for an Organization. 
        The main aim of the project is to make the shopping process easy and digitalized. Without the internet and technology, the shopping is done by visiting different shops and buying items. This process takes a lot of time and energy. The aim is to minimize the time waste in shopping visiting different shops. The project aims to make the shopping process automated using internet and technology services. The project involves analyzing the environment and then building a suitable shopping site which can be used by customer to buy goods and services. </p>

		<p>The project reduces the amount of time spend on travelling and shopping. It makes the shopping process more efficient and convenient and easy to access. This also allow user to make comparison between products and buy the most comprehensive product in best price. The goal is also to make the internal communication and functioning process smooth and efficient for the customers along with other different information sharing. </p>
        <p>In the system, user can see various products and they can filter it by categories. They can compare the product and then can buy the product. The product will be then delivered to the customer. The system also contains the admin panel, which is used to make track of products and purchase details.</p>

       <h3> Problem Identification</h3>
        <p>The problem that is faced by people in real life is taken as the motivation for this project. It is very hard for people with tight schedule to do shopping visiting different places. This motivated to build the system. The web user can use the internet and the website to search the products they want rather than visiting the actual shop. The website is an open platform where every user can visit and perform shopping. The user does not need to login or provide personal information until they order some items. </p>
        <p>The website will be built using the most advance technology and the most popular web programing language. This helps the developer to be more familiar with the technology and use the learnt skills on other modules of the course to implement the concept in single huge project. </p>
        <p>The main aim of the website is to bridge the gap between the shop owner and customer. Customer from any place can see the product and perform the shopping. </p>
        <p>The cost is another factor that is considered before building the system. Analyzing the scenario, their will be high return of investment if the system is built as per plan and within the time frame. The website targets the wide audience so many customers can be lure and huge profit can be gained.</p>
